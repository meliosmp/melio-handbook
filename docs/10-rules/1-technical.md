# Technical Rules

:::info
**Everyone has different standards** for what counts as cheating and what is fair in Minecraft. Consequently, the Technical Rules regulate technical aspects of the game iin order to to level the playing field for everyone.
:::

* **TNT duping is allowed, but all other duping is NOT allowed**

  Duping rails, carpets, and other blocks are **NOT** allowed. You may not dupe TNT to
  hoard or store, only to ignite.

* **Chunk loaders require explicit permission from staff**

  DM one of us or open a ticket to inquire about this,
  we can allow them on a case-by-case basis.

* **No autoclickers or macros**

  Autoclickers (client-side mods and software) are **NOT** allowed; same goes with Baritone and macros/scripts.

* **No second / alt accounts**

  Every member is allowed only one account on the server.

* **No x-ray**

  Using any external resource or mod to gain any informational advantage while mining falls under this. This includes, but is not limited to: using x-ray packs or xray mods to find ores, using FreeCam or a minimap mod's "cave mode" to find caves and underground structures.

  Please also note that this is one of the most common cheats we ban for, so we are telling you from the start before you "try" it and get caught. If you are 100% determined on using x-ray, don't bother. Cheaters are not welcome.

<!-- * **No auto-reconnect**

  This is in regards to our AFK policy: AFK as you wish – we don't dictate how you can or cannot AFK (there is no auto-kick), but we reserve the right to kick AFK players if and when server is lagging. Consequently, auto reconnect is **NOT** allowed. -->

* **List of Allowed Mods**

  If a mod is not in the list below, it is **NOT** allowed. However, this list is subject to change. Feel free to open a ticket to ask / request for a specific mod to be allowed, if it has never been requested before. We can also make exceptions on a case-by-case basis, **solely** for accessibility reasons.

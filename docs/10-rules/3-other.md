# Others

### 1. Districts and Land Sharing

- No farms, bases or personal builds around spawn. (see `/spawn`)

- Maximum one banner marker per player base.

- Banner markers are not land-claims. Use them reasonably... or else.

- When building in a district, try to maintain the aesthetic of all your builds and farms to match the district's style.

- When building near other players or building in a district, please communicate with your neighbours! We can avoid misunderstandings about the land being used by simply reaching out to our neighbours.

- Avoid making massive craters in the main world when digging up gravel, dirt, sand – we have a resource world for that!

### 2. Inactivity

To ensure our world can properly last through endless seasons and cycles of new and old players, we have to free up old unused space so they can be built on again. The following criteria dictate the requirements that allow us to remove builds/farms:

- (1) The build is inside one of the DISTRICTS, and player's `inactivity > 4 months`. OR...
- (2) player’s `playtime < 25 hours`, and `inactivity > 8 months`. OR...
- (3) player’s `playtime < 5 hours`, and `inactivity > 4 months`. OR...
- (4) player was handed a permanent ban. The banned player does not hold the right to hand over their base and belongings to another player. We reserve this right, even if they appeal and get unbanned afterwards.
- (5) EXCEPTIONS are made for projects that are considered community landmarks, and can be made on a case-by-case basis. This is not promised and subject to staff judgement.
<!-- - (5) **UNLESS…** one of the following is true (*all subject to staff judgement)*:
    - player’s build was a significant community landmark
    - player’s inactivity was explained, and they intend on returning to Melio
    - they are still very active on Discord, and they intend on returning to Melio -->

### 3. Trust & Abuse

Our community puts trust as one of the most fundamental values that keeps everything going.
We reserve the right to treat any **intent of abuse** the same as its potential worst case scenario.
We reserve the right to make our own judgement on what we deem as malicious intent, 
and what we deem as an innocent mistake.

### 4. Ban Appeal

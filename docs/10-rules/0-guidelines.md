# Basic Guidelines

:::info
We are a trust-based community.
By joining Melio, we expect you to have common sense and mutual respect
for everyone else, and **we hope you will play in good faith**.
:::

### 1. Use common sense and have basic etiquette

  Jerks and immature children are not welcome here.

  We want everyone to feel like they belong in Melio, and everyone plays a role in shaping our welcoming community. We expect everyone to co-exist without needing to be told things like "don't be rude" or "don't harass people".

### 2. No griefing or stealing

  Thieves and griefers are not welcome here.

  We are a trust-based server and have no chest-locking or land-claiming plugins, as we believe they stifle creativity. However, we monitor for theft very closely, and we enforce this rule strictly. All container and block interactions are logged, so **we see EVERYTHING**. Only take what is yours, or what is labelled 'for public use'. A good rule of thumb is: **if it ain't yours, don't touch it!** If you need something, you can always ask.

### 3. No cheating
  
  Cheaters are not welcome here. This includes using hacked clients and x-ray.

### 4. Avoid political or religious discussion

  The nature of these topics that are heated, divisive, and provocative, means
  that they have no place on Melio. 
  It's quite simple: this is a Minecraft server, we are here to play the game.
  If you wish to discuss about these topics, you can do so outside the server
  (which includes the Discord and the Minecraft server).

This is all you need to know. There are 3 more pages dictating more
specific rules about different aspects of Melio, 
and we advise you to read them. However, at their core, it's all really just the first rule:

***❝ Use common sense and have basic etiquette❞***

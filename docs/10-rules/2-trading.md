# Trading Rules

For information about how to open up a shop in the Market District, see [Opening a Shop](/docs/getting-started/trading). However, please note that everything here applies to any form of trading, inside or outside the Market District.

## 1. Principles

- **BE TRANSPARENT**: We believe in honest and transparent trade. Dishonest, deceitful, and misleading practices that can harm other merchants or customers go against this principle. We disclose as much information and truth as we can.

- **EMBRACE COMPETITION**: We believe in an open, free market where everyone can freely compete for market share. Anti-competition efforts are no fun.

- **BE FAIR**: We believe in a market that is fair for everyone. Selling unattainable items, which should not have any monetary value, is not allowed.


## 2. Do's and Dont's

Follow the DOs and refrain from the DONTs.

#### ✅ DO:
- Label prices CLEARLY, with “diamonds” or “diamond blocks”.
- For items, label prices inside the container AND on a sign/item frame.
- Include at least one ender chest in your shop.

- [Optional] Post your shop on Discord and on the Market District Map (near portal)!

#### ❌ DO NOT:
- Label prices ambiguously, for example with abbreviations like “dia” or “db”.
  <details>
  <summary>Why?</summary>
  
  We ask for prices to be labelled clearly because we've had a history of having to deal with people underpaying in shops when prices are not labelled in a way that avoid ambiguity or misunderstanding.

  If and when a shop owner reports repeated cases of people mispaying or underpaying in their shop, the burden falls onto the staff team who have to deal with the same issues over and over. So we think it's in everyone's best interest to have the prices labelled clearly instead.
  </details>
- Make a “general store” that sells everything without a specific theme (e.g. the following are OK: bamboo store, coloured wool shop, mediterranean building blocks, the everything-pink-coloured shop).
- Trade or sell Artifacts or other custom collectibles
- Resell items from another shop
- Put farms, lit beacons, banner markers, and portals for personal use inside the Market District
- Open a shop in your personal base (this can be allowed with staff permission, on a case-by-case basis)

## 3. Extra
- Gambling is allowed, provided you are not scamming anyone or being dishonest. We expect you to give your best effort in disclosing the rates.

## 4. Intervention
- If your shop remains **unstocked for over 14 days**, we will send you a reminder to restock.
- If your shop remains **unstocked 14 days AFTER our shop restock reminder**, we reserve the right to
remove, demolish, or take over your shop. 
- When responding to a restock reminder, we expect you to do a complete and thorough restock.
- When you purchase a plot, the "14 days" until a restock reminder starts counting.
- If your shop was seized, taken over, or demolished by staff (for not keeping it stocked, or rule-breaking), the diamond payment for purchasing the plot will not be returned.
- We reserve the right to request for changes / removal (or simply remove a shop ourselves) if we deem it to violate one of the three trading principles.
- Any change in shop ownership or voluntary shop removal must be reported to staff via a ticket.
- Feel free to DM us or open a ticket if you need clarification about the Trading Rules.

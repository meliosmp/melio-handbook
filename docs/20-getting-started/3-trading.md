# Market District

Our diamond-powered economy is as straight-forward as it gets; we use diamonds as a currency and do NOT use any Auctions or Shop GUI mod. Since most shops require you to take the items you purchased out of a chest and put the payment inside, our economy runs on *YOUR* honesty. 

**We take theft *very seriously*. See the rules.** Shoplifters not only have to deal with Staff, but you will also have to deal with angry Melio members who see that you are taking advantage of our 'honesty system'. If you are still considering theft, I suggest re-evaluating whether Melio is the right server for you or not.

### Opening a Shop

:::info

See the [Trading Rules](/docs/rules/trading) for the rules about making your own shop.

:::

**Complete instructions on how to claim land for your very own shop are available in-game on a lectern.**
You can find it on the Market Board (near the Market District portal). To summarize the instructions, however:
1. You can claim any unused 11x11 area as a "plot".
2. Make your payment for the plot on the Market Board. Ensure it is labelled with your username and the coordinates of it (e.g. `Livving -100, -153`)
3. You can start building! Give some space in-between shops, allow for decoration. Decoration will not be considered as an area you claimed.
4. If you make your shop bigger than the "plot" that you claimed, you will be asked for pay for additional plots.

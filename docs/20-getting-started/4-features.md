Generally, the features we add to Melio are intended to encourage collaboration and improve quality of life when working on any project. Here are the features that have not been covered yet in the three previous Handbook pages.

### Pronouns

You probably already know about the Pronoun roles on Discord, but there's a separate way to show your pronouns in-game. You can set your pronouns in-game with `/pronouns set <pronouns>`, which will then be visible to anyone when hovering over your username in the chat.

### Simple Voice Chat

We have [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat/) for those who want to use it!
This is completely optional.

### Voting

Voting is a way for Minecraft server lists to rank all the Minecraft servers on their platform. The more votes a server has, the more likely a user will discover the server. Each player can only vote once per site, every day. 
We've implemented an optional system to allow you to vote and get small gifts in return. With your vote, you can help us reach more people and find new members for our community.

When you vote, you will get a Voting Token that you can exchange to Wandering Traders. The Wandering Traders offer over 30 different possible trades in exchange for Voting Tokens, so check them all out!

You can vote for us here: https://www.meliosmp.com/vote

### Wandering Traders & Villagers

Wandering Trader spawning logic has been changed to be per-player instead of global.
Additionally, you will be notified in chat when a wandering trader spawns near you.

Villagers in the End have global discounts, which means any discounted trades they offer will be available at the same price to everyone (instead of just to one person)!

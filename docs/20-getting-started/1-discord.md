# The Discord

### About the Discord Server

The Discord server is Melio's hub, where you'll find announcements, updates, and more. 
If you are new to using Discord, read this official 
[Beginner's Guide to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord) 
before continuing to the rest of this page.

### Joining for the First Time

When you first join our Discord, you'll find 3 text channels: `#announcements`, `#read-me`, and `#apply-here`

- `#read-me` is a MUST-read for anyone who intends to apply to Melio. It contains the rules, links, and other information you need to know.
- `#announcements` is where official server announcements will go.
- `#apply-here` is, as the name suggests, where you should go when you are ready to apply. 

When you press the button to begin your application in `#apply-here`, the Discord Bot "Appy" will automatically send you a Direct Message (DM) and begin asking questions. It should take 5-10 minutes to answer all the questions. Once submitted, we will review your application within the same day.

:::info
You will receive a notification from the Appy Bot once your application has been reviewed.

### Linking Your Discord Account

Once your application for membership is **accepted**, you will encounter this message when you try to connect to the Minecraft server for the first time:

To link your account, open Discord and then look for the `#link-your-account` channel. The instructions there should be very simple to follow.

### Opening a Ticket (Modmail)

A ticket is a request or mail that you can send to the staff team when you need assistance, guidance, or clarification;
it's the most effective way to contact staff.
You can open a ticket in the form of a private Discord thread, by following these steps:

1. Open the `#help` channel, near the top of the channels list.
2. Press the "Open a Help Ticket" button
3. You will be added to a `#ticket-xxx` channel. Type in your request or complaint, and a staff member will get to you soon.

### Keeping your Discord Account safe

Discord accounts are generally very vulnerable; hacked Discord accounts aren't uncommon, and unfortunately it's very easy for anyone to fall for a scam that ends up compromising account security.

If you're not aware, [THIS](https://youtu.be/Z3lyynl7hP8?si=4GOQfTn34BgPZVTZ) (YouTube link) is what's possible. It happens a lot more often and to a lot more people than you may realize. We suggest reading this official Discord article below to better understand how to secure your Discord account:

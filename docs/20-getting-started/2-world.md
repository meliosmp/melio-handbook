# The World

The world has been running since 21 February 2025, with a seed not publicly released.
You spawn at -300, -300 in the overworld and the spawn region extends 500 blocks – we'll be using this area for community projects!

### Live Map

We have a live map at https://map.meliosmp.com that displays our worlds in real-time. The intended use is not for people to claim land, but for people to be able to connect with each other and find server landmarks more easily.

### Banner Markers

The [banner marker](https://modrinth.com/mod/squaremap-banner) 
is a system that allows the use of banners to create markers visible 
to everyone throughout the live map.

To create your own marker in-game, get any `Banner` and rename it as you wish. Place it down. Then, crouch and right click on it while holding a `Map` (map cannot be empty). Your marker should instantly be visible on the live map.

<!-- When you walk near the marker, you will get a notification on your action bar as shown below. 
We will be using this mechanism for district markers! TODO: add image below -->

### Nether Hub

Since we don't do teleports or warps of any kind, we have a hub on top of the nether roof connecting
everyone's portals together. Consider putting your base portal on the roof, too! 
Just label it properly :)

:::tip

Use `/portalfromnether` and `/portalfromoverworld` to easily do the math for nether portal coordinates.

### Market District
The Market District is an area dedicated to shops and other economy-related activities. 
Our economy runs on diamonds, and shops rely on *your* honesty to work (we don't use Auctions 
or Chest Shop plugins).

### Resource Worlds
Resource worlds are a pair of two worlds (a resource overworld, and a resource nether) that will be reset every few months, solely for the purpose of resource-gathering. 

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

This feature is a necessity that solves two previous problems at once:

- Difficulty in obtaining non-renewable resources increases over time (e.g. sand, calcite, raw quartz, netherite, diamonds, structures) requiring subsequent expeditions to be further and further from spawn.
- New items from new Minecraft updates being unavailable in a world whose chunks have all been pre-generated or explored (e.g. pale oak wood, creaking heart, and resin when updating to 1.21.4). We cannot continue expanding the world border perpetually, forever.
</details>

**Accessing the Resource Overworld**

You will find a glowstone portal at X: -400, Z: -300, walking through it will bring you to the Resource Overworld. 
- don't break the glowstone portal, we will consider it griefing.
- you cannot recreate your own glowstone portal (you may try)
- end portals are disabled in the resource worlds
- player-generated nether portals are disabled in the resource worlds
- mobs cannot walk through the glowstone portal
- do not make permanent builds there since resource worlds are temporary

**Accessing the Resource Nether**

The nether portal to the Resource Nether can be found inside the Resource Overworld; check the live map to find it. Like with end portals, you cannot make your own obsidian portals in both resource worlds.

**Resource worlds Rules**

You ARE allowed to decimate the resource world's terrain. Other than that, the same general rules that apply anywhere on Melio apply here as well: use common sense. For example: no selfishly "claiming" land for its resources. No malicious death traps. Last but not least, remember: **NO permanent builds in resource worlds**. Don't be stupid ^-^

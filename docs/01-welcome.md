In case you missed it, the name Melio originates from the word **meliorism**:
> *the belief that the world gets better, the belief that humans can improve the world.*

Here in Melio, we are fans of the idea that every single block placed in a world was placed
by a human being. Every base, farm, and machine is the fruition of individuals working
together to create something beyond themselves.

:::info

**Please don't sell or trade: mini-blocks, customized armour stands, or provide any other Backer perks as a service to other players.**

:::

### Discord Role

After you purchase your rank, you should automatically receive the pink coloured Backer/Backer+/etc role. 
You can check by seeing if you can view a section of Discord channels called "Backers Lounge".

### In-game Prefix

Vanity prefix; it should show as a coloured crown on the left of your username. You may request to
have this removed.

### Monthly Riddles (Miniblocks)

**About**

The Block Collector (BC) is a villager who roams around the server every month to trade miniblocks with players. Their location will be shared ONLY to Backers every time he moves to a new spot.

**What can I obtain?**

BC offers trades for miniblocks, which are player heads that have the texture of Minecraft blocks. Every month, the miniblocks offered will change. For example, on July 2024 you can get mini-blocks of sea lanterns, kelp blocks, and more.

**What do I need in order to trade with BC?**

Some diamonds and the actual block versions of the mini-blocks (e.g. to trade for mini kelp blocks, so you need to prepare diamonds and kelp blocks).

**Where can I find BC?**

That's the beauty of it. With the help of our riddles, you will have to find them yourself **every month**! :wink:

### Emojis

You can type `:100:` and `:thumbsup:` among other emojis in chat, and it will automatically turn your message into an emoji.

### Coloured Username

You can use `/nickname set <HEX>username`, but include the `<>` brackets. For example, to rename yourself pink you can do `/nickname set <#FF00FF>username`. You could also do `/nickname set <pink>username`. If you use hex, use a RGB hex code generator to help you:

Backer+ also gives you access to gradients, do `/nickname set <gradient:HEX1:HEX2:HEX3>username` up to any number of colours (between 2 colours to an infinite number of colours). For example, a blue to pink gradient would be `/nickname set <gradient:#0000FF:#FF00FF>username`.

# Hosting your Own Event

:::info

You don't need staff permission to host events! This page is to guide you
if this is your first time and need guidance on how to get started.

:::

With only 2 admins in the staff team, there's only so much we can do. 
That's why we're inviting YOU to create and host your own event –
whether it's a tournament, a co-op minigame, or something else, we'd love to see you make it work.

So, let's say you have an event idea. And you have what it takes to make it happen.
Awesome! To get started, try answering these questions:

1. What is the event about?
2. What's your "elevator pitch" – a very short headline to explain the event concept?
2. What sort of preparations would you need to organize this event?
3. How would running or hosting this event look like?
4. Do you need external assistance to make the event work? e.g. commands, spectator mode, etc.
6. Do you have any references? e.g. maps, youtube videos

Reach out to silw or CesiumCat via Discord DM with your idea, or open a Ticket. We can have a discussion and try to
tweak the event concept if needed, then we'll let you know how we can proceed. It usually 
starts with either a playtest, a brainstorm session, or we go straight to rewards and start/end dates.

Depending on the event you have in mind, we may connect you with the Event Team for extra support.

It doesn't have to be the world's most novel idea, it just has to be fun and come from *you*.

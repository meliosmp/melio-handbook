# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General

<details>
<summary>This handbook is a lot! Do I have to read everything before joining?</summary>

Nope! Read at your own pace. or not at all; I'm not your mom.
But I suggest at least reading the rules / basic guidelines.
</details>

<details>
<summary>So are you vanilla or modded?</summary>

Our server runs on Fabric, which allows us to operate with a few server-side mods. Server-side means you don't have to install anything and can connect with a vanilla client.

While a lot of our server-side mods only help with the day-to-day management of the server, a few do offer features as mentioned in [here](/docs/getting-started/). We try our best to provide a vanilla-like experience, only adding extras that have minimal disruption to the core gameplay.

<details>
<summary>What is a whitelist / whitelisted server?</summary>

If a server is whitelisted, it means only a certain list of people (the whitelist)
are able to join that Minecraft server. Melio opens the process of joining this whitelis
to everyone, meaning you too can join the server by applying.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How old is the world & when will you reset?</summary>

The current world has been running since February 2025!

We don't have a schedule or cycle for world resets, 
but we hope to make this a long-term world that can last 
for years to come.
</details>

<summary>Where is the server hosted?</summary>

Our server is hosted in Europe.

### Joining Melio

<details>
<summary>How do I join the server?</summary> 

Apply for whitelist via our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/3zNhq8H6ek).
</details>

<details>
<summary>What should I expect when applying to join?</summary>

There will be 8 questions; with your answers, we want you to express yourself as best as you can!
There are no right or wrong answers, we only want
to make sure you're a match for the community but also that the server is the right match
for you and what you're searching for in a Minecraft server.
</details>

<details>
<summary>I can't apply for whitelist! I get an "Error sending DM" response from the bot.</summary>

See [this article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060145013-Why-isn-t-my-DM-going-through) by Discord 
on why the bot may be unable to send you a DM on Discord.
</details>

<details>
<summary>My application was denied! Can you tell me why?</summary>

We filter through whitelist applications to make sure that everyone we accept in Melio is a good fit for the
community. It's likely that we rejected your application because we believe you'll be better off looking for another server.

If you would like to re-apply, please open a ticket on Discord explaining why you want to re-apply. 
We may decide to allow you to re-apply, however this is done **only on a case-by-case basis**. 
By default, we do not allow repeat applications.
</details>

<details>
<summary>I'm already whitelisted on Melio, but my friend's application got rejected. How can I play with them?</summary>

Open a Help Ticket on Discord, or contact staff; we can look into it on a case-by-case basis.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I link my account?</summary>

See [Linking your Discord Account](/docs/getting-started/discord#linking-your-discord-account) for more information.
</details>

<details>
<summary>My application was accepted, but when I join the Minecraft server, I get a code instead.</summary>

Link your account; see above.
</details>

### For Existing Members

<details>
<summary>When will the server update to Minecraft version 1.XX?</summary>

Updating the server to the newest Minecraft version will take some time and we
make no promises of when that will happen.

The way Mojang implements breaking technical changes to the game (gradually), combined with the 'game drops' release cycle (frequent), added with Fabric's constant breaking API changes, means it's going to be really difficult for mod developers to continue updating their mod to the newest version for every new Minecraft version. Since we rely on a few core server-side mods to operate, we are dependent on
mods staying up-to-date.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can you add X mod to the server?</summary>

Please go through the `#feedback` channel to see if this was discussed previously.
If not, feel free to suggest it.
</details>

<summary>Am I allowed to use Y mod myself?</summary>

See the 'Technical Rules' section.

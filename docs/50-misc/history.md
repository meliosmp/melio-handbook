# History

### Background

On 23 March 2024, a tiny server initially named *Sil's World* was launched with
a simple idea: an SMP offering a straight-forward vanilla Minecraft experience. 
Plugins, if any, would only be added to smoothen, maintain, or enhance the core gameplay; 
not change it.

About three months later, we rebranded to Melio, initially taken from the word **meliorism**.

### Worlds

We have done exactly ONE world reset on February 2025. This time round, we removed our custom world generation and focused on what people loved in Melio: the vanilla aspect (Minecraft) and the collaborations (community)!

### Guiding Principles

As time went by, our community grew in size and our philosophy evolved into these three principles that we now follow loosely:

#### 1. Maintain the “core” vanilla gameplay experience.
    - We refrain from disrupting or changing it, instead enhancing the core gameplay and adding features that complement it
    - Feature creep and unwanted mechanics that go against this feel are to be avoided

#### 2. Keep the spirit of open communication between everyone.
    - Make room for dialogue wherever possible – punishments are only for last resorts.
    - We always take everyone's opinions into consideration, and act in everyone's best interest.

#### 3. In growing and maintaining the “tight knit community”, we need to take great care in protecting the community. 
    - This is mainly done through filtering who we let in (external) and ensuring no active members pose a threat to the community’s spirit (internal).
    - Since we run on a trust system, we rely on this fabric of trust between every member. Bad actors can ruin the experience and tarnish this communal trust.

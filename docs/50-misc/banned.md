# Reflection

So if you're reading this, you were probably given a ban or suspension and was asked to read this. 
This page serves as an invitation for *you* to think in retrospect and reflect.

### The Community

We're trying to maintain and protect this community of diverse individuals from all walks of life, from
different continents, and different cultures, in this melting pot of cultures that is a Minecraft server. That means
we need every member to do their part in keeping this space a safe haven for everyone.

Despite not having this written in clear detail on the `#read-me` rules, we believe we shouldn't need to
dictate you on everything that you can or cannot do – the idea is that being a decent human being shouldn't
require a tutorial. If there is anything in particular, however, you can just ask about it.

If you were temporarily suspended, all we hope is that you come back having reflected on your actions.

### The Game

Giving players the freedom to create without land claims and grief prevention, or the ability
to create interactive games and shops without chest locks or chest claims, all require everyone to trust
each other.

We don't ask for much.

If you intend on playing again, we ask that you play with respect for other people. 
This isn't an anarchy server, a factions server, a UHC world, or a "drama" SMP where 
everyone's trying to make the most edge-of-the-seat intense PvP content. A lot of people are
here to wind down after school, college or work – or use it as a creative outlet for their build ideas 
and farm design.

Thanks for reading, have a great day.

When we first initiated the Melio Council, the vision was simple: 
to give everyone the opportunity to contribute back 
to our beloved community; the opportunity to
shape and improve other people's experience on the server.
<!-- truncate --> 
While the implementation of execution of the Melio Council has evolved 
over the past 10 months (especially in recent weeks), the vision has remained.

In the spirit of our vision, we would like to open this role
for everyone through an open recruitment. This means that joining
Council will be a more transparent and inclusive process, and it will
no longer be an invite-only opportunity.

## About

The Melio Council is an initiative to create a space for esteemed members 
to pursue leadership opportunities in the community. Council members will
get to work on a variety of different tasks (depending
on your interests) whether that's spearheading in-game community projects,
working on the next events, or moderating and keeping the peace.

This open recruitment is intended for those of you acclimated to the
community and are interested in becoming Council.

There are two tracks under Council:
1. Artisans: Develop the next server events and lead community projects.
2. Staff: Stewards of Melio; foster and engage with the community.

Please note that these tracks are not mutually exclusive, and 
you don't have to decide between one or the other *now*.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>So what's the difference between Council and Staff?</summary>

Staff members oversee and guide Council, among other things. Staff also have "final say".
</details>

<details>
<summary>I'd love to help out with the server, but I don't see myself as a good fit to moderate.</summary>

One misconception we're trying to correct is the idea that Council is only for "mod helpers". This is incorrect (see above), so if engaging with the community in a moderation position isn't your cup of tea, then the Artisan track might be for you!
</details>

<details>
<summary>What do you look for in a potential Council candidate?</summary>

There are a lot of factors involved in our selection. Instead of trying to fit
a certain mold of what we need, we suggest applying anyway if you're interested.

What's the worst that could happen? A (non-permanent) rejection?
</details>

<details>
<summary>You mention Council involves "a variety of different tasks", so will 
I need to do everything?</summary>

Nope! We want to give Council the room to do what they're more interested in – 
part of that initiative is the two tracks, artisan and staff.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How long are Council applications open for?</summary>

About 1-2 months (since August 2025)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you have any requirements? (e.g. my age, how long I've been a member, my skills)</summary>

There are no hard requirements. 

However, we do prefer members who have been on Melio for a while (over a month) 
and have more life experience.
</details>

<details>
<summary>I've been banned before, can I still apply for Council?</summary>

Yes.
</details>

<details>
<summary>If I apply and get rejected, can I apply again in the future?</summary>

Yes.
</details>

<details>
<summary>I'm interested, but I have other personal concerns!</summary>

Feel free to DM silw or CesiumCat about your concerns :)
</details>

<details>
<summary>I've filled out the application form. How long will a response take?</summary>

You can expect a response to take between 1-3 weeks. 
When Council applications close, however, we won't be processing any more applicants.
